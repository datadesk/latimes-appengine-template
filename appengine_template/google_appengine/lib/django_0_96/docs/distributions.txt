===================================
Third-party distributions of Django
===================================

Several third-party distributors are now providing versions of Django integrated
with their package-management systems. These can make installation and upgrading
much easier for users of Django since the integration includes the ability to
automatically install dependancies (like database adapters) that Django
requires.

Typically, these packages are based on the latest stable release of Django, so
if you want to use the development version of Django you'll need to follow the
instructions for `installing the development version`_ from our Subversion
repository.

Linux distributions
===================

Debian
------

A `packaged version of Django`_ is available for `Debian GNU/Linux`_, and can be
installed from either the "testing" or the "unstable" repositories by typing
``apt-get install python-django``.

When you install this package, ``apt`` will recommend installing a database
adapter; you should select and install the adapter for whichever database you
plan to use with Django.

The Debian ``python-django`` package is also available for `Ubuntu Linux`_, in
the "universe" repository for Ubuntu 7.04 ("Feisty Fawn"). The `current Ubuntu
package`_ is also based on Django 0.95.1 and can be installed in the same
fashion as for Debian.

For distributors
================

If you'd like to package Django for distribution, we'd be happy to help out!
Please join the `django-developers mailing list`_ and introduce yourself. 

We also encourage all distributors to subscribe to the `django-announce mailing
list`_, which is a (very) low-traffic list for announcing new releases of Django
and important bugfixes.
