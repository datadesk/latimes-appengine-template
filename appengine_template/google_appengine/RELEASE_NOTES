- The maximum rate per queue at which tasks are processed has been increased to
  100 tasks per second.
- The maximum number of concurrent requests for a single queue can be specified

  of rate limiting. The current number of running tasks is also displayed in
  the Admin Console.

- Admin Console logs viewer now displays time as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm.
- The Mail API added KML and KMZ files as allowed attachments.

  release.
- Added a warning when an admin tries to upload a queue.yaml where the number
  of new queues and the number of disabled queues exceeds 100.
- Django 1.2.5 is available via use of the use_library() declaration. This

    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3931


Version 1.4.1
================================
- During application creation, developers can choose between two Datastore
  configurations: High Replication or Master/Slave.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/hr/#Selecting_a_Datastore
- You can set your application's datastore to read-only mode in the Admin
  Console. Any writes attempted while the app is set to read-only will throw a
  CapabilityDisabledError. This feature can be helpful for migrating or copying
  data between two applications.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/applicationsettings.html#Disable_Datastore_Writes
- The Datastore Admin tool has been updated to allow copying of one app's
  datastore to another. The destination app must have the Remote API enabled.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/datastoreadmin.html
- The deadline for offline URL Fetch API requests for Python and Java have been
  increased to a maximum of 10 minutes. The default deadline for offline
  URL Fetch requests remains the same.
- Fixed an issue where an AttributeError was occasionally thrown on a datastore
  query.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4196

Version 1.4.0
================================
- The Always On feature allows applications to pay and keep 3 instances of their
  application always running, which can significantly reduce application
  latency.
- Developers can now enable Warmup Requests. By specifying  a handler in an
  app's app.yaml, App Engine will attempt to send a Warmup Request to initialize
  new instances before a user interacts with it. This can reduce the latency an
  end-user sees for initializing your application.
- The Channel API is now available for all users.
- Task Queue has been officially released, and is no longer an experimental
  feature. The API import paths that use 'labs' have been deprecated. Task queue
  storage will count towards an application's overall storage quota, and will
  thus be charged for.
- The deadline for Task Queue and Cron requests has been raised to 10 minutes.
  Datastore and API deadlines within those requests remain unchanged.
- For the Task Queue, developers can specify task retry_parameters in their
  queue.yaml.
- Apps that have enabled billing are allowed up to 100 queues with the Task
  Queue API.
- Metadata Queries on the datastore for datastore kinds, namespaces, and entity
  properties are available.
- URLFetch allowed response size has been increased, up to 32 MB. Request size
  is still limited to 1 MB.
- The request and response sizes for the Images API have been increased to
  32 MB.
- The total size of Memcache batch operations is increased to 32 MB. The 1 MB
  limit on individual Memcache objects still applies.
- The attachment size for outgoing emails has been increased from 1 MB to 10 MB.
  The size limit for incoming emails is still 10 MB.
- Size and quantity limits on datastore batch get/put/delete operations have
  been removed. Individual entities are still limited to 1 MB, but your app may
  batch as many entities together for get/put/delete calls as the overall
  datastore deadline will allow for.
- When iterating over query results, the datastore will now asynchronously
  prefetch results, reducing latency in many cases by 10-15%.
- The Admin Console Blacklist page lists the top blacklist rejected visitors.
- The automatic image thumbnailing service supports arbitrary crop sizes up to
  1600px.
- Overall average instance latency in the Admin Console is now a weighted
  average over QPS per instance.
- The developer who uploaded an app version can download that version's code
  using the appcfg.py download_app command. This feature can be disabled on
  a per application basis in the admin console, under the 'Permissions' tab.
  Once disabled, code download for the application CANNOT be re-enabled.
- Fixed an issue where custom Admin Console pages did not work for Google
  Apps for your Domain users.
- In the Python runtime, an instance is killed and restarted when a request
  handler hits DeadlineExceededError. This should fix an issue related to
  intermittent SystemErrors using Django.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=772
- Allow Django initialization to be moved to appengine_config.py to avoid
  Django version conflicts when mixing webapp.template with pure Django.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1758
- Fixed an issue with OpenId over SSL.
  http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3393
- Fixed an issue on the dev_appserver where login/logout code didn't work using
  Python 2.6.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3566
- Fixed an issue in the dev_appserver where get_serving_url did not work
  for transparent, cropped PNGs:
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3887
- Fixed an issue with the DatastoreFileStub.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3895

Version 1.3.8
==================================
- Builtin app.yaml handlers are available for common application functions,
  such as appstats.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig.html#Builtin_Handlers
- The Admin Console now provides an experimental tool to delete all entities in
  the datastore or all entities of a given type. This is available only if
  enabled using the datastore_admin builtin. Deleting entities will count
  against application quota.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/creatinggettinganddeletingdata.html#Deleting_Entities_in_Bulk
- You can run task queue tasks immediately from the Admin Console.
- You can now specify the quality of JPEG images via the Image API's
  execute_transforms function. Available in production only.
- Support for login of multiple Google accounts within an app, and longer login
  sessions. For more information see:
    http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=181599
- In queue.yaml, the maximum allowed bucket size is now 100.
- Precompilation is now enabled by default. To disable, use the
  --no_precompilation flag when updating your app.
- BlobInfo now has an open() method that returns a BlobReader.
- BlobReader now accepts a BlobInfo.
- Removed limits on zigzag merge-join queries. Therefore the error "The built-in
  indices are not efficient enough for this query and your data. Please add a
  composite index for this query." will no longer be thrown in most cases,
  enabling more types of queries without indexes.
- Fixed an issue with task queue tasks not running on the dev_appserver when
  using Python 2.6.
- Fixed an issue on the dev_appserver where auto task running wasn't working for
  BulkAdd.
- Fixed an issue reserving App Ids by owners of similarly-named mails accounts
  containing periods, multiple cases, and googlemail.com address.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1196
- Fixed an issue on the development server where PNGs were being returned as
  JPEGs.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3661

    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3152
