"""A module that handles deferred execution of callables via the task queue.

Tasks consist of a callable and arguments to pass to it. The callable and its
arguments are serialized and put on the task queue, which deserializes and
executes them. The following callables can be used as tasks:

1) Functions defined in the top level of a module
2) Classes defined in the top level of a module
3) Instances of classes in (2) that implement __call__
4) Instance methods of objects of classes in (2)
5) Class methods of classes in (2)
6) Built-in functions
7) Built-in methods

The following callables can NOT be used as tasks:
1) Nested functions or closures
2) Nested classes or objects of them
3) Lambda functions
4) Static methods

The arguments to the callable, and the object (in the case of method or object
calls) must all be pickleable.

If you want your tasks to execute reliably, don't use mutable global variables;
they are not serialized with the task and may not be the same when your task
executes as they were when it was enqueued (in fact, they will almost certainly
be different).

If your app relies on manipulating the import path, make sure that the function
you are deferring is defined in a module that can be found without import path
manipulation. Alternately, you can include deferred.TaskHandler in your own
webapp application instead of using the easy-install method detailed below.

When you create a deferred task using deferred.defer, the task is serialized,
and an attempt is made to add it directly to the task queue. If the task is too
big (larger than about 10 kilobytes when serialized), a datastore entry will be
created for the task, and a new task will be enqueued, which will fetch the
original task from the datastore and execute it. This is much less efficient
than the direct execution model, so it's a good idea to minimize the size of
your tasks when possible.

In order for tasks to be processed, you need to set up the handler. Add the
following to your app.yaml handlers section:

handlers:
- url: /_ah/queue/deferred
  script: $PYTHON_LIB/google/appengine/ext/deferred/handler.py
  login: admin

By default, the deferred module uses the URL above, and the default queue.

Example usage:

  def do_something_later(key, amount):
    entity = MyModel.get(key)
    entity.total += amount
    entity.put()

  # Use default URL and queue name, no task name, execute ASAP.
  deferred.defer(do_something_later, 20)

  # Providing non-default task queue arguments
  deferred.defer(do_something_later, 20, _queue="foo", countdown=60)
