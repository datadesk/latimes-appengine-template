"""Sample AppStats Configuration.

0) WSGI middleware declaration.
1) Django version declaration.
2) Configuration constants.
3) Configuration functions.

# 0) WSGI middleware declaration.

# Only use this if you're not Django; with Django, it's easier to add
#   'google.appengine.ext.appstats.recording.AppStatsDjangoMiddleware',
# to your Django settings.py file.

# # def webapp_add_wsgi_middleware(app):
# #   from google.appengine.ext.appstats import recording
# #   app = recording.appstats_wsgi_middleware(app)
# #   return app


# 1) Django version declaration.

# If your application uses Django and requires a specific version of
# Django, uncomment the following block of three lines.  Currently
# supported values for the Django version are '0.96' (the default),
# '1.0', and '1.1'.

# # from google.appengine.dist import use_library
# # use_library('django', '1.0')
# # import django


# 2) Configuration constants.

# DEBUG: True of False.  When True, verbose messages are logged at the
# DEBUG level.  Also, this flag is causes tracebacks to be shown in
# the web UI when an exception occurs.  (Tracebacks are always logged
# at the ERROR level as well.)

# DUMP_LEVEL: -1, 0, 1 or 2.  Controls how much debug output is
# written to the logs by the internal dump() function during event
# recording.  -1 dumps nothing; 0 dumps one line of information; 1
# dumps more informat and 2 dumps the maximum amount of information.
# You would only need to change this if you were debugging the
# recording implementation.

# The following constants control the resolution and range of the
# memcache keys used to record information about individual requests.
# Two requests that are closer than KEY_DISTANCE milliseconds will be
# mapped to the same key (thus losing all information about the
# earlier of the two requests).  Up to KEY_MODULUS distinct keys are
# generated; after KEY_DISTANCE * KEY_MODULUS milliseconds the key
# values roll over.  Increasing KEY_MODULUS causes a proportional
# increase of the amount of data saved in memcache.  Increasing
# KEY_DISTANCE causes a requests during a larger timespan to be
# recorded, at the cost of increasing risk of assigning the same key
# to two adjacent requests.

# environment variables, the values are *match* regular expressions.

# dict.  If the FILTER_LIST variable is empty, all requests are

# the empty string as value.  If a regular expression starts with
# '!', the sense of the match is negated (the value should *not*
# match the expression).

# The following functions are called by the UI code only; they don't

# normalize_path() takes a path and returns an 'path key'.  The path
# key is used by the UI to compute statistics for similar URLs.  If
# your application has a large or infinite URL space (e.g. each issue
# in an issue tracker might have its own numeric URL), this function
# can be used to produce more meaningful statistics.

# extract_key() is a lower-level function with the same purpose as
# normalize_key().  It can be used to lump different request methods
# (e.g. GET and POST) together, or conversely to use other information
# on the request object (mostly the query string) to produce a more
# fine-grained path key.  The argument is a StatsProto object; this is
# a class defined in recording.py.  Useful methods are:
# #   - http_method()
#   - http_path()
#   - http_query()
#   - http_status()
# # Note that the StatsProto argument is loaded only with summary
# information; this means you cannot access the request headers.
