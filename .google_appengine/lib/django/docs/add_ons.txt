============================
The "django.contrib" add-ons
============================

Django aims to follow Python's `"batteries included" philosophy`_. It ships
with a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common Web-development
problems.

This code lives in ``django/contrib`` in the Django distribution. Here's a
rundown of the packages in ``contrib``:

.. _"batteries included" philosophy: http://docs.python.org/tut/node12.html#batteries-included

admin
=====

The automatic Django administrative interface. For more information, see
`Tutorial 2`_.

.. _Tutorial 2: ../tutorial2/

auth
====

Django's authentication framework.

See the `authentication documentation`_.

.. _authentication documentation: ../authentication/

comments
========

A simple yet flexible comments system. This is not yet documented.

contenttypes
============

A light framework for hooking into "types" of content, where each installed
Django model is a separate content type. This is not yet documented.

csrf
====

A middleware for preventing Cross Site Request Forgeries

See the `csrf documentation`_.

.. _csrf documentation: ../csrf/

formtools
=========

A set of high-level abstractions for Django forms (django.newforms).

django.contrib.formtools.preview
--------------------------------

An abstraction of the following workflow:

"Display an HTML form, force a preview, then do something with the submission."

Full documentation for this feature does not yet exist, but you can read the
code and docstrings in ``django/contrib/formtools/preview.py`` for a start.

humanize
========

A set of Django template filters useful for adding a "human touch" to data.
To activate these filters, add ``'django.contrib.humanize'`` to your
``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting. Once you've done that, use ``{% load humanize %}``
in a template, and you'll have access to these filters:

apnumber
--------

For numbers 1-9, returns the number spelled out. Otherwise, returns the
number. This follows Associated Press style.

Examples:

    * ``1`` becomes ``'one'``.
    * ``2`` becomes ``'two'``.
    * ``10`` becomes ``10``.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.

intcomma
--------

Converts an integer to a string containing commas every three digits.

Examples:

    * ``4500`` becomes ``'4,500'``.
    * ``45000`` becomes ``'45,000'``.
    * ``450000`` becomes ``'450,000'``.
    * ``4500000`` becomes ``'4,500,000'``.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.

intword
-------

Converts a large integer to a friendly text representation. Works best for
numbers over 1 million.

Examples:

    * ``1000000`` becomes ``'1.0 million'``.
    * ``1200000`` becomes ``'1.2 million'``.
    * ``1200000000`` becomes ``'1.2 billion'``.

Values up to 1000000000000000 (one quadrillion) are supported.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.

ordinal
-------

Converts an integer to its ordinal as a string.

Examples:

    * ``1`` becomes ``'1st'``.
    * ``2`` becomes ``'2nd'``.
    * ``3`` becomes ``'3rd'``.

You can pass in either an integer or a string representation of an integer.
